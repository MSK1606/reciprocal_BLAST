#KaiABC - It is all about the timing#

This repository contains all my IPython notebooks that I used for my analysis during my master thesis. The notebooks include the code to get, preprocess, and analyze the data and prepare the graphics.

The raw and preprocessed data is currently not publicly available, but I'm happy to share everything, just write me an [email](mailto:nicolas.schmelling@hhu.de).

In the future I will try to biuld an easy to use tool that allows anyone to perform the same analysis on their own research question. 

If you have any question about the code or anything else just let me know: [email](mailto:nicolas.schmelling@hhu.de) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/bio_mediocre)
