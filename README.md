# Reciprocal BLAST Tool in Python

This repository contains the code (see below) of the preprint "Minimal Tool Set for a Prokaryotic Circadian Clock" on [bioRxiv](). 

I will try to build a python package for reciprocal BLAST searches with that code.

If you have any question about the code or anything else please let me know: [email](mailto:nicolas.schmelling@hhu.de) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/derschmelling)

### Minimal Tool Set for a Prokaryotic Circadian Clock

The code for the preprint can be found [here](https://github.com/schmelling/reciprocal_BLAST/tree/master/notebooks).
